    "One of the most used machine learning algorithms is recommendation systems. A **recommender** (or recommendation) **system** (or engine) is a filtering system which aim is to predict a rating or preference a user would give to an item, eg. a film, a product, a song, etc.\n",

    "There are two main types of recommender systems:Â \n",

    "- Collaborative filters\n",
    "  \n",
    "Content-based filters predicts what a user likes based on what that particular user has liked in the past. On the other hand, collaborative-based filters predict what a user like based on what other users, that are similar to that particular user, have liked. Among collaborative-based systems, we can encounter two types: **user-item** filtering and **item-item** filtering. \n",
