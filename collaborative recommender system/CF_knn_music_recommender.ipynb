    "One of the most used machine learning algorithms is recommendation systems. A **recommender** (or recommendation) **system** (or engine) is a filtering system which aim is to predict a rating or preference a user would give to an item, eg. a film, a product, a song, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which type of recommender can we have?   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of recommender systems: \n",
    "- Content-based filters\n",
    "- Collaborative filters\n",
    "  \n",
    "> Content-based filters predicts what a user likes based on what that particular user has liked in the past. On the other hand, collaborative-based filters predict what a user like based on what other users, that are similar to that particular user, have liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously developed a content-based recommendation system. Now, we'll look into collaborative filtering. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Collaborative filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filters work with an interaction matrix, also called rating matrix. The aim of this algorithm is to learn a function that can predict if a user will benefit from an item - meaning the user will likely buy, listen to, watch this item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among collaborative-based systems, we can encounter two types: **user-item** filtering and **item-item** filtering. \n",
