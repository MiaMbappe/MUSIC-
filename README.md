# Music recommender system

A **recommender** (or recommendation) **system** (or engine) is a filtering system which aim is to predict a rating or preference a user would give to an item, eg. a film, a product, a song, etc.
  
There are two main types of recommender systems:

- Content-based filters
- Collaborative filters

However, nowadays a combination of both approaches is used.

> *Content-based methods are based on the similarity of item attributes and collaborative methods calculate similarity from 
> interactions*.
